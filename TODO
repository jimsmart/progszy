TODO
====


Progszy
=======

- Check cache folder location exists on startup, otherwise fail to start.



SQLite cache rotation/archival method
-------------------------------------
- HTTP handler for REST API.
- Support method: list current dbs.
 - List all .sqlite files.
 - Process list into groups by prefix.
- Then for given database: call the create func, and kick out the old reference from the map (plus cleanup/close)
- Trigger via a REST API.
- Locking around db access (per db)...?
- Move/archive/create new db.


Proxy chaining
--------------
- Not essential initially.
- Set upstream proxy URL via CLI param.
 - See https://www.admfactory.com/how-to-setup-a-proxy-for-http-client-in-golang/
   or see existing scraper code.


Controls via HTTP headers
-------------------------

- Skip/change response size limitation? (useful if we want to fetch the 290mb sitemap)
- Skip cache put? (useful if we want to fetch the 290mb sitemap)
- Skip cache fetch (passthrough)? - is this even useful??


HTTP Client / Server tuning
---------------------------
- http://tleyden.github.io/blog/2016/11/21/tuning-the-go-http-client-library-for-load-testing/


Cleanups
--------
- Create cache folder if it does not exist?
- The main request handler is getting crufty.
- Disable existing logging
- Refactoring
- http.Client/Transport configuration - See https://medium.com/@nate510/don-t-use-go-s-default-http-client-4804cb19f779
- Server transport configuration.
- Minor optimisation: Add Head method to Cache interface. NBD, we don't use HEAD.
- Review remaining TODO comments throughout code.
- We seem to be using a version of goproxy from 2018 - can we update?


Testing
-------
- Test all 'fiddly' headers work as intended (ETag, etc)


Language / lang negotiation
---------------------------

- Accept-Language (req) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Accept-Language
- Content-Language (resp) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Language
 - We need to store this in the cache.
  - DB mods - done
  - Passing in - refactor and use cacheRecord
- We need to handle language negotiation


Content negotiation
-------------------
- We likely need to handle content negotiation


Logging
-------
- What is retryablehttp using? Is it https://godoc.org/github.com/go-kit/kit/log/level ???
- What is goproxy using?
- Can we control log-level via an HTTP header? Then we can get logging per scraper/client/request.
- We really only need Debug and Error, according to Dave Cheney. But then what about stats logging?


Cookies
-------
- We don't handle them specifically. NBD, I think?


Authentication
--------------
- Not supported. Not a current use case.


Extra HTTP status headers
-------------------------

- If we send the appropriate status info back, perhaps the spider/scraper
  can make more informed decisions?
  - Name of the cache bin (including timestamp) ...?
  - Duration of upstream request ...?
  - Underlying error details ...?

- The same for incoming headers, which could control behaviour:
 - Rejection patterns. (Done)
 - Logging.
 - Db/storage 'bin' name?
 - Robots.txt behaviour? - Decided to handle this in the scraper component/package.
 - Retry rules?



Example scraping websites
-------------------------

http://example.webscraping.com
http://toscrape.com
https://webscraper.io/test-sites


Config file
-----------

- I think most of this is now redundant...

- Port to listen on (could be param) - implemented as CLI param

- Reject rules
 - Alternatively, reject rules could be ditched in favour of
   dedicated cache-cleaners, and more error checking in the spider/scraper.
 - Or reject rules could be passed in via HTTP headers? - Now implemented.

- Retry rules
 - At a basic level, these could be hard-coded instead, or defauts,
   and/or the spider/scraper could use a retrying client.
 - Currently using defaults. NBD for now.



DONE
====

Improve Cache interface
-----------------------
- Refactoring...
- Make methods use cacheRecord ...?


goproxy
-------
- Should we split our primary method, moving all the response processing / cache put into different goproxy handler?
 - Pros: cleans up primary method. splits some code.
 - Cons: splits some code. less control over returned response if we allow goproxy to pipe the real response. Not ideal. Consistency is good.
- Done: we split the handler, but continued to only use a single API hook in goproxy.



Controls via HTTP headers
-------------------------

- IgnoreInsecureSSL option - perhaps low priority? 
  I don't believe we currently have any sites using self-signed/out-dated SSL certs, 
  but we may do later. And the 'toscrape' sites (used in tests) have self-signed certs.
  An out-dated cert is a possible future gotcha.
 - Use HTTP headers to pass option - "X-Cache-SSL: INSECURE"
 - Use option when setting up outgoing HTTP client.


goproxy
-------

- Set up a test harness. - done
- Set up a proxy (start with HTTP). - done
- Pass client requests through it. - done
- Examine method hooks. - done
- Try logging/intercepting things. - done (mitm)
- Repeat with HTTPS. - done

- Our primary method's interface must implement: func(r *http.Request) *http.Response
 - See https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy/blob/master/responses.go#L17

- Refactor primary method accordingly.
- Swap HTTP handler in Run method.

SSL
---

- In progress, above.

- There's two parts to this, http proxy-side, and the client.
 - The client needs specific setup, to not fail on bad certs
   (because a proxy is basically a MITM attack).
  - See https://www.socketloop.com/tutorials/golang-disable-security-check-for-http-ssl-with-bad-or-expired-certificate
  - See also https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12122159/how-to-do-a-https-request-with-bad-certificate
 - The server needs... ? See:
 https://github.com/hauke96/tiny-http-proxy
 http://www.bizcoder.com/caching-is-hard-draw-me-a-picture
 https://medium.com/@mlowicki/http-s-proxy-in-golang-in-less-than-100-lines-of-code-6a51c2f2c38c
 https://github.com/gmarik/cdp-proxy

 - Maybe just use https://github.com/elazarl/goproxy

 - Another option is for the client to rewrite all HTTPS requests to use HTTP, although this would mean redirects.
  - Perhaps we could pass a flag in the headers, and rewrite back to HTTPS in the proxy? This is starting to sound ugly though :/
  - It might be easier to give up on the proxy server idea, and just include bits of progrszy as a library.



SQLite cache
------------

findDatabase()
 - do we know its file location already? 
  - use domain-slug as map key, rlock the map first.
  - yep, return resulting file location from the map.
 - wlock the map, check again.
  - yes, we have a file location - must've been another thread.
  - return resulting file location from the map.
 - keep the wlock
 - find all files starting with domain-slug, ending with .sqlite
  - if we found any:
   - sort them, find the one with the newest timestamp in its name
    - stick it into the wlocked map, and return it.
  - otherwise, make a new filename from domain-slug and timestamp
   - create an empty database with that filename.
    - stick it into the wlocked map, and return it.


Path handling / work folder
---------------------------

- Need to allow for a configurable path/folder for cache location.
- Fixup all proxy code.
- Fixup tests to use their own folder.


Client Retry
------------

- Integrate https://github.com/hashicorp/go-retryablehttp
- Note that this means outgoing HTTP requests can now take a long time,
  do we need to ensure that the HTTP server and the requesting client can cope with this ok? (Noted in code in a TODO)


Reject rules
------------
 - Regexp rules passed in via HTTP headers (X-Cache-Reject)
 - Cache regexp rules, preventing regexp.Compile overheads.


Main func / cmd
---------------

- Launch proxy.
- Shutdown.
- Handling of CLI params.


Sundry
------

- Refactor Cache interface to use CacheRecord.

- Fixup all missing header stuff:
 - Etag (persist and fetch)
 - Last-Modified (persist and fetch)
 - Content-Language (persist and fetch)
 - Content-Size (persist and fetch)

- Document header stuff.


- We need to make content_type part of our primary key.

- we should not be using client.Get, we should instead be building a Request
- we should also copy across headers from incoming to outgoing Request
